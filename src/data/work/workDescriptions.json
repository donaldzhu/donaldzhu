As such, the X marks the individual civic\n  act of voting—a common element shared by Canadian citizens across different cultures.</p>","memory-of-memories":"<p>\n  This book is an exploratory look into the subject of memory through the experimental technique of acetate ink\n  transfer. It is a method that imperfectly imprints onto surfaces by lifting the ink from the acetate, making the\n  outcome lighter with every transfer. “Imprinting,” “copying,” and “fading”—all of which connect to the shapes of\n  memories, making it an apt topic for the formal investigation.\n</p>","object-bulb":"<p>A rigorous formal exploration of incandescent light bulbs—an object found in quotidian contexts—as an elementary step\n  into understanding <i>making as research.</i> While the study remained largely visual, the outputs inextricably\n  suggest connections to a greater context beyond the object itself.</p>","roll":"<p>(Part of my <a href=\"work/vector-spin-stroke\">investigation on tools</a>).</p>\n<p>An early prototype of its motorized version—<a href=\"work/spin\"><i>SPIN</i></a>.

To position design as an investigative activity is to favor a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down\n  one. The former discovers, unearths, and assesses, while the latter predetermines, prescribes, and dictates. Thus, a\n  tool is something that stands between oneself and their outputs—it sets up the conditions within one's processes. As\n  such, tool-making is an activity through which I choose to structure my investigations within graphic design.</p>\n<p>\n  For this study, the toolset has been chosen to intersect with the field of typography. Namely, using tools to\n  construct and deconstruct type and look at the conditions with which visual communication wrestles. It is examined\n  through three categories: <i><a href=\"work/vector-struct\">VECTOR</a></i> is interested in the physical manipulation of\n  parametric type; <i><a href=\"work/spin\">SPIN</a></i> studies the\n  interaction between typography, topology, and motion; and <i><a href=\"work/stroke\">STROKE</a></i> explores the\n  relationship between the writing hand,\n  styluses, and letterforms. Being constructed physically, the material nature of the tools gives them different\n  performances and affordances. As such, to build tools from the ground up is to allow them to be potential openings to\n  material reality, through which new modes of thinking and making could emerge.\n</p>","vector-string":"<p>(Part of my <a href=\"work/vector-spin-stroke\">investigation on tools</a>).</p>\n<p>The 2D iteration of <i><a href=\"work/vector-struct\">VECTOR-STRUCT</a>:</i> an assortment of glyphs drawn on layers\n  of\n  vellum, which are then connected at\n  their\n  anchor points with strings.</p>\n<p><i>By borrowing the logic of interpolation, VECTOR began as an exercise in deconstructing the forms of the flat nib\n    pen\n    to investigate the relationship between parametric parts.
