<p>The 2D iteration of <i><a href="work/vector-struct">VECTOR-STRUCT</a>:</i> an assortment of glyphs drawn on layers
  of
  vellum, which are then connected at
  their
  anchor points with strings.</p>
<p><i>By borrowing the logic of interpolation, VECTOR began as an exercise in deconstructing the forms of the flat nib
    pen
    to investigate the relationship between parametric parts. It grants one the ability to manipulate the points, lines,
    areas, and volumes via movement by connecting the layers with elastic material. Through its material resistance, it
    provides kinaesthetic feedback to specific actions (rotation, displacement) and intrinsic typographic properties
    (min-max distances, weight, contrast, etc.). As such, the resulting formal studies are an iterative, embodied
    process
    of unearthing vector relations within physical typographic forms.</i></p>
