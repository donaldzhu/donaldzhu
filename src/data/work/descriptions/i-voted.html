<p><i>I VOTED!</i> was a competition by OCAD U and Instagram to design a story sticker for the 2019 Canadian election.
  My runner-up proposal reappropriated the “X” symbol from the previous Ontario election campaign. Additionally, it was
  paired with multilingual designs, set in a playful, rounded custom typeface. As such, the X marks the individual civic
  act of voting—a common element shared by Canadian citizens across different cultures.</p>
