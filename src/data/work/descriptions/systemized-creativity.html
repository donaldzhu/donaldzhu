<p>This book documents my first year of formal graphic design education. Contrary to preconceived notions of
  “creativity”—a spontaneous, result-driven approach—systems and processes play a much more integral role in design.
  Through the help of design languages and reflections, design decisions can be made conscious and autonomous. By
  structuring a systematic approach, the conditions and parameters of any given inquiry become visible and iterable,
  allowing the investigation to be exhaustive. This book employs one such self-describe system to illustrate the
  concept.</p>
