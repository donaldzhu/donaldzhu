<p>A speculative design project about a new mind-altering drug in a hypothetical future. Via the effects of this
  substance and the assistance of machines and fungi, human users’ consciousness dissolves together to form a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium">mycelium-like</a>, distributed network. Through this system, humans
  act as individual hypha—meat-based AIs—to lend their computational power to nature in a symbiotic relationship. As
  such, the speculative concepts surrounding this drug offer us narratives to provide thoughtful critiques about our
  current conditions.</p>
