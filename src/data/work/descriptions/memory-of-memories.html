  This book is an exploratory look into the subject of memory through the experimental technique of acetate ink
  transfer. It is a method that imperfectly imprints onto surfaces by lifting the ink from the acetate, making the
  outcome lighter with every transfer. “Imprinting,” “copying,” and “fading”—all of which connect to the shapes of
  memories, making it an apt topic for the formal investigation.
