<p>A new identity system for the University of Toronto’s nascent Game Studies program. Using custom game icons, I
  developed a generative tool in p5.js to translate 3D renderings of gaming platforms into ASCII outputs—a form of
  rendering that traces back to early game design history. With the addition of <a

    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>
  as overlay patterns, the tool is made procedural and reactive. As such, the sum of these elements of gaming makes up
  the whole of “game studies.”</p>
