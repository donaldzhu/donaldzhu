<p>The 3D iteration of <i><a href="work/vector-string">VECTOR-STRING</a>:</i> an assortment of physical letters whose
    sides are connected by elastic fabrics.

<p><i>By borrowing the logic of interpolation, VECTOR began as an exercise in deconstructing the forms of the flat nib
        pen
        to investigate the relationship between parametric parts. It grants one the ability to manipulate the points,
        lines,
        areas, and volumes via movement by connecting the layers with elastic material. Through its material resistance,
        it
        provides kinaesthetic feedback to specific actions (rotation, displacement) and intrinsic typographic properties
        (min-max distances, weight, contrast, etc.). As such, the resulting formal studies are an iterative, embodied
        process
        of unearthing vector relations within physical typographic forms.</i></p>
