<p>(Part of my <a href="work/vector-spin-stroke">investigation on tools</a>).</p>
<p><i>SPIN</i> is a cylindrical, multi-layered, motorized type-rotation device. It is interested in investigating optics
  and
  the ways in which type physically appears. By intersecting typography with related areas of concern, such as
  occlusion, motion, and topology, the resulting outputs are studies of how typography oscillates between
  recognition and obfuscation. Like <a href="work/roll"><i>ROLL</i></a>, its shape introduces a fundamental 3D volume
  with simple cyclical
  motion, making the resulting outputs combinatoric.</p>
