<p>(Part of my <a href="work/vector-spin-stroke">investigation on tools</a>).</p>
<p><i>STROKE</i> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph">pantograph</a> mechanism to translate
  writing gestures through different styluses.
  The primary holder uses a pencil, while the secondary holder can be adapted with any drawing instrument. As one
  end moves, the other followsâ€”it is an encoded replication system that outputs marks with
  different qualities based on the same letterform, depending on the nature of the stylus. As such, it explores the
  historically significant connection between styluses, styles, glyph systems, and languages.</p>
