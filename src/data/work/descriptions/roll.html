<p>(Part of my <a href="work/vector-spin-stroke">investigation on tools</a>).</p>
<p>An early prototype of its motorized version—<a href="work/spin"><i>SPIN</i></a>. It consists of multiple toilet paper
  rolls with printed text wrapped around their surfaces. The user can rotate the objects against each other to generate
  combinations of typographic forms. As a result of their curvatures, each cylinder warps the letterforms and casts
  shadows on adjacent rolls. As such, ROLL is a tool that’s concerned with topology and combinatorics.</p>
