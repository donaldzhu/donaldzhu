<p><i>VECTOR, SPIN, STROKE.</i> is an ongoing series that explores the role of tools and tool-making within design
  investigations. To position design as an investigative activity is to favor a bottom-up approach instead of a top-down
  one. The former discovers, unearths, and assesses, while the latter predetermines, prescribes, and dictates. Thus, a
  tool is something that stands between oneself and their outputsâ€”it sets up the conditions within one's processes. As
  such, tool-making is an activity through which I choose to structure my investigations within graphic design.</p>
<p>
  For this study, the toolset has been chosen to intersect with the field of typography. Namely, using tools to
  construct and deconstruct type and look at the conditions with which visual communication wrestles. It is examined
  through three categories: <i><a href="work/vector-struct">VECTOR</a></i> is interested in the physical manipulation of
  parametric type; <i><a href="work/spin">SPIN</a></i> studies the
  interaction between typography, topology, and motion; and <i><a href="work/stroke">STROKE</a></i> explores the
  relationship between the writing hand,
  styluses, and letterforms. Being constructed physically, the material nature of the tools gives them different
  performances and affordances. As such, to build tools from the ground up is to allow them to be potential openings to
  material reality, through which new modes of thinking and making could emerge.
