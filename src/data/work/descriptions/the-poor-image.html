<p>A web version of Hito Steyerl’s <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image/"><i>In
      Defense of the Poor Image</i></a>—an essay concerned with poor images whose quality degrades due to circulation
  and compression. While the reader peruses the passages, popular images and website screenshots pop up like illicit
  ads, forcing them to wade through the obstruction. Inadvertently, as one drags away the elements, they become
  participants in curating the new context for these poor images.</p>
